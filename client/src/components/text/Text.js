This project was a full redesign of NowTV for NBCU's Peacock video streaming application. <br/>
This was my first time working on a video streaming application for TV. It was very different to 
coding on web but a great experience working with different environments such as Xfinity, Samsung 
and LG TVs.`;

As the sole Frontend React developer, I was given creative control to architect, design and 
implement the USC user interface. I also had the pleasure of creating two decentralised applications
for network permissioning. This was amazing role that enabled me to problem solve rapidly and 
delivery with very short deadlines.`;

I worked on Template Designer, a vanilla Javascript web application with a similar look and feel to 
Photoshop. The application is used by The Times and Sunday Times editorial to create article 
templates. This was a great role as it gave me a fundamental understanding of vanilla JavaScript 
without frameworks.`;
